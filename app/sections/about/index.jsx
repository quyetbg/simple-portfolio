							My name is Quyet.I developed a deep passion for web programming, and I
							consistently engaged in learning new concepts and techniques in this field.
						</p>
						<p>So, officially, my programming journey began in 2021 as a Drupal developer.</p>
						<p className="my-3.5">
							I enjoy learning technologies that interest me, which is why I dedicated a significant
							amount of time to working with Drupal.
						</p>
						<p>
							One day, I decided to try something new, and I started learning React. I was so
							excited to see how fast I can build a website with it, and how easy it is to maintain
							it. Consequently, I quickly learnt Next.js and I used it to build some company
							projects working in a team with a backend dev.
						</p>
						<p className="my-3.5">
							In May 2024, I had an opportunity to start working as a Swift developer for a
							company with the possibility of transitioning to mobile development. I was skeptical
							about it at first, but I decided to give it a try, and I don&lsquo;t regret it. Now, I
							thoroughly enjoy working with Swift.
